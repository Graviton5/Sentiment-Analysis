# Sentiment-Analysis
 A Project I did for one of my College Course.
 The Project contains the Sentiment Analysis I have done on Kaggle Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
 The Project uses NLTK and sklearn libraries for processing, the Machine Learning models that the Project works for are SVM and KNN and the results of both are analyzed using various metrics and data visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib
